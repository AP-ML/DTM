CHANGELOG:

Build #013: [Stinger]
-Tidy up of the game text concerning the 4 buildings that can be created by spies.
-Bribed Leaders, External Influence and Misinformation are classed as temporary buildings (10 turns).
-Fifth Column is classed as permanent building (always has been this way in the code, I haven't edited this).
-Fifth Column's bonuses have been changed from -gold/-production to -4 espionage/-10 espionage defence bonus. 
I feel these bonuses are appropriate because spies working undercover in a city could broadcast enemy movements back to base.

Build #012:
- [TLR] Added Pearian Supremacy civ, General Pear leader.
  - UB: Watch Tower (Castle that reduces city maintenance)
  - UU: Guardian (Longbowman with extra movement points, first strikes)

Build #011 [Stinger]:
-Added a new folder in Assets/Sounds called Diplomacy. This contains the piece of music I intend to use.

UNIQUE UNIT: Deceiver - Spy with Double Movement Speed and starts with Deception 1 promotion.
UNIQUE BUILDING: Den of Spies - Library with +2 espionage and 2 spy specialists.
*NOTE: Coding for Espionage Units will need to be looked at, as currently they don't have any promotions.

- Minor changes to buildings.
- [ANQ] Minor changes to audio.

Build #009 [Pz]:

  - UB: Refinery (Forge with +35% hammers vs. +25%, some health benefits from resources) (Subject to change)
  - UU: Bombardier (Grenadier with collateral damage potential, +25% attack vs. archery and gunpowder units, replaced the +50% attack vs. rifles)
