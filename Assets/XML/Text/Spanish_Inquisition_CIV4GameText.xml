It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms, and to replace the medieval inquisition which was under papal control. The new body was under the direct control of the Spanish monarchy. It was not definitively abolished until 1834, during the reign of Isabel II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The Inquisition, as an ecclesiastical tribunal, had jurisdiction only over baptized Christians. The Inquisition worked in large part to ensure the orthodoxy of recent converts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]The tribunal was an institution that had precedents in other Inquisitions. In the 15th century, as the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon united under the Catholic monarchs and concluded the Reconquista with the conquest of Granada, anxiety about the cultural unity of the country grew. Suspicions were especially raised against Jews who had recently converted to Christianity, called conversos or derogatively marranos, as many doubted the sincerity of these conversions. Indeed, many Jews had been baptized to escape violent anti-Jewish outbursts around 1400. In 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered all remaining Jews who would not convert to Christianity to leave the kingdoms.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Various motives have been proposed for the monarchs' decision to found the Inquisition, such as increasing political authority, weakening opposition, doing away with conversos, and greed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Ferdinand II of Aragon pressured pope Sixtus IV to agree to let him set up an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support at a time when the Turks were a threat to Rome. Sixtus IV later accused the Spanish inquisition of being overzealous and accused the monarchs of being greedy. The Pope issued a bull to stop the Inquisition but eventually was pressured into withdrawing it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]During the 16th century a new enemy was found - Protestants, about 100 of whom were burned as heretic. An index of prohibited books was drawn up that were found to contain heresy. Converts from Islam, called Moriscos, were also targeted by the Holy Office. The Spanish Inquisition was an institution at the service of the monarchy, but had to follow procedures set up by the Holy See. Most of the inquisitors had a university education in law. The procedures would start with Edicts of Grace, wherein people were invited to step forward to confess their heresy, and to denounce other heretics. Those so denounced were detained. A defense counsel was assigned to the defendant, a member of the tribunal itself, whose role was to advise the defendant and to encourage him or her to speak truthfully. A Notary of the Secreto meticulously wrote down the words of the accused. The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking for the completeness of their documentation. The percentage of cases where torture was used as a means for gaining confessions varied, but, in general, was quite rare. According to a BBC documentary, in the city of Valencia out of over 7,000 documented cases, less than 2% experienced any torture at all, usually lasting for no more than fifteen minutes, and less than 1% were tortured more than once. Sentences varied from fines to execution (also rare - below 2%) and those condemned had to participate in the ceremony of auto de fe (act of faith). The arrival of the 18th century slowed inquisitorial activity and it was definitively abolished on July 15, 1834.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]In the mid-16th century to the mid-17th century, a time when Europe was torn apart by Catholic-Protestant strife, there began to appear from the pens of various European Protestant intellectuals, who generally had minimal or no direct access or experience of the Inquisition, what has come to be known as the Black Legend, as part of the Protestant polemic in support of the Protestant Revolution. With the gradual ebbing of religious hostilities professional historians began investigations, giving a detailed, nuanced and less exaggerated picture of the Inquisition.</English>
